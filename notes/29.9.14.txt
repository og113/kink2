to do:
is DDS symmetric? if not to what degree?
find negative eigenvales and eigenvectors of DDS in c++, probably best to use lapack or something similar
reinstall eigen (and maybe subsiduaries too) on laptop - too many errors!


notes from today's talk with toby and arttu:
1) consider compactifying time
2) consider factoring off oscillatory behaviour (especially important in compactified time)
3) need to do x-x0=int(dp/sqrt(2*V(p))) integral for the case of degenerate minima - this is because otherwise there are oscillations which are not invertible - V has linear term so integral doesn't converge (ish)
4) consider rewriting laplacian with higher accuracy - can massively reduce the number or required lattice points - spectral representation so that k^2 is represented exactly, rather than sin(k^2) or whatever we have now

more recent notes:
need to develop main
-loop over input files:
	in order to do this it would be good to have the file linked uniquely to the inputs used to generate it
	write some code to come up with some unique numbering system - perhaps based on date and time
	files could be linked this way - i.e. data files and inputs files
	want a second mainInputs file which just has a couple of numbers used to define the range of files loaded
-merge with pi.cc which has had lots of printing etc improvements - add functions to calculate erg, linErg etc.
-need to sort out linErg - this is v important and is linked to sorting out the boundary conditions for non-zero theta
	first, use by-hand definitions of discrete fourier transforms and see how that compares
-should add a check that erg is not too large for the lattice spacing

only later is it worth putting in all that stuff with dE->epsilon and using other potentials and finding p by integrating numerically
