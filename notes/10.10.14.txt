to do at work:
-try nonzero theta
-get results from main for periodic instantons, plot lines of E vs Num, plot F(E) for the periodic instantons
-get results from main for a range of epsilon
-consider dE*F vs E and F vs E in the limit dE->zero

to do at work, or in cam:
-relate dE to epsilon, properly
-translate matlab code for arbitrary V to c++
-put in V from dl, integrate as arttu recommended

-if E*a/pi/Num is too large (which it seems to be), can try toby's idea of factor off known dependences
-should sort out eigen/blas/lapack/superlu etc for cosmos
-parallelize code
