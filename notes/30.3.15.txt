to do next:
	want to reproduce results of tinyakov and kuznetsov so:
		- need to step with F=const
			- to do this stepper needs to be improved to incorporate information from legendre transform
			- dF = (dF/dT)*dT + (dF/dtheta)*dtheta and dF/dT|theta = -T*dE/dT|theta -theta*dN/dT|theta etc.
			- should replace the bool constant with an enum giving options for stepping
			- the stepper should also have a bias within 180 degrees. so we need to store the initial angle angle0
			- angles which are within angle0+/-pi/2 are allowed
	should think about whether and if so why dE/dT|theta>0 unlike in the DL model.
	should look for bifurcations of solutions in the regions where F>0
	it is important to check whether or not solutions tunnel. i.e. extend them with pi3.cc or piEvolve.cc
		- ideally piEvolve would not use phi/r but phi directly. it would also take V in like main.
		- that way it could be more easily used for other potentials
		- likely this isn't worth the faff though and working with a rejigged pi3.cc may be preferable. or simpy with a working piEvolve as it is
	we should look at the locations of singularities in the solutions. as well as the solution between C and D there should be ones of the real(t) axis. these were found in dl2015
	we should also consider the continuum limit of our solutions, alla dl2015.
